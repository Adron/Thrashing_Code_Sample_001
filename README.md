# Thrashing Code Repo X

I put together this project in recent [video stream starting at 1:32:40](https://youtu.be/sg4Nnnb-Vvc?t=5560).

Here's the time slices with respective topics pertinent to this repo, for the full video head over to youtube to watch it.

<a  href="https://youtu.be/sg4Nnnb-Vvc?t=5560s">1:32:40</a> - Creating a new application with Jetbrains Goland to show off how to use the Go core libraries around the user, JSON, and some basic file creation and writing.

<a  href="https://youtu.be/sg4Nnnb-Vvc?t=5800s">1:36:40</a> - At this point I start adding some basic code to pull the current user and collect some information about that user.

<a  href="https://youtu.be/sg4Nnnb-Vvc?t=6042s">1:40:42</a> - I extract the error code using the Goland refactoring feature and setup a `func check()` for error checking. That cleans up the inline code a bit.

<a  href="https://youtu.be/sg4Nnnb-Vvc?t=6190s">1:43:10</a> - Here I add to the user data retrieved some environment variables to that list of collected data. I also cover again, as I have a number of times, how the environment variables are pulled in IDE versus user session versus out of IDE.

<a  href="https://youtu.be/sg4Nnnb-Vvc?t=6466s">1:47:46</a> - Now I add a file exists check and start working on that logic.

<a  href="https://youtu.be/sg4Nnnb-Vvc?t=6536s">1:48:56</a> - Props to Edd Turtle on a solid site on Go. Here's the blog entry, and respectively the path to more of Edd's material @ https://golangcode.com/. Also, Edd seems like a good guy to follow [@eddturtle](https://twitter.com/eddturtle).

<a  href="https://youtu.be/sg4Nnnb-Vvc?t=7293s">2:01:33</a> - Starting the JSON Work here to marshal and unmarshall.

<a  href="https://youtu.be/sg4Nnnb-Vvc?t=8793s">2:26:33</a> - At this point I push the code up to Github using the built in Goland VCS features. I realize I've named the repo "adron" by accident so I rename it, close Goland, and then clone the code back down locally with Goland's VCS features. It's kind of interesting to see Goland go through the 2-factor auth for this too.
